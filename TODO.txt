Version 0.01
------------
* Check the root error edge of incorrect nodes with the multithreading module instead
  of processing them sequentially.


Version 0.02
------------
* Computing all of the gradients for the root error edges at one time causes `Out of Memory Error`
    Fix: Root error edge gradients are accumulated in mini batches but still applied in one step.
        Version 0.021
        ------------
        * The current training data is not in the form of batches.
            Fix: Structured data is not separated into batches.
Cleanup: Images saved during training are now saved to the "training_images" folder.


Version 0.03
------------
* Switch segmentation data to Cremi Electron Microscopy Images.
* Switch functions and classes from the jupyter notebook to a python file.
