Version 1.0
------------
* Working f_static

Version 1.01
------------
* Check the root error edge of incorrect nodes with the multithreading module instead
  of processing them sequentially.


Version 1.02
------------
* Computing all of the gradients for the root error edges at one time causes `Out of Memory Error`
    Fix: Root error edge gradients are accumulated in mini batches but still applied in one step.
        Version 1.021
        ------------
        * The current training data is not in the form of batches.
            Fix: Structured data is not separated into batches.
Cleanup: Images saved during training are now saved to the "training_images" folder.


Version 1.03
------------
* Optimize MSF calculations by calculating all newly disccovered edges at once rather than computing them one at a time.


Version 1.04 - Current Version
------------
* Instead of computing all of the gradients for the root error edges at once, the gradients are accumulated over mini-batches of at most 32 elements.



Backlog
-------
* Correct nodes and accuracy are not ouputing the correct values.
* Switch segmentation data to Cremi Electron Microscopy Images.
* Switch functions and classes from the jupyter notebook to a python file.


Known problems
--------------
* Root error edge children calculation takes way too long and needs to be optimized.
* Gradients need to be computed in mini-batches to avoid memory issues.
